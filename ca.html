<b>Place of Birth:</b>	New York City<br>
<b>Identity:</b>	Publicly known<br>
<b>Legal Status:</b>	Citizen of the United States<br>

                 illustrator, special SHIELD operative.<br>

<b>Powers</b>: Strictly speaking, Captain America possesses no superhuman powers; however,his body has 
			   been mutated to the pinnacle of human perfection. He possesses strength, agility,
			   endurance, speed, and reflexes superior to any Olympic-level athlete, and his
			   bodily functions have been enhanced to the peak of human efficiency.His body 
			   eliminates build-up of fatigue-producing poisons, granting him phenomenal endurance.<br><br>
<b>Weaponry</b>:Captain America carries a virtually indestructible shield composed of a
			    unique Vibranium-steel alloy created through a process that has never been duplicated.
				A concave disk two and a half feet in diameter and weighting twelve pounts, the shield 
				has excellent aerodynamic properties and can be hurled to rebound off of solid objects
				with minimal loss of angular motion. Captain America has long since honed its use to
				the point that he can use it to defflect attacks and knock out adversaries in tandem 
				with his own acrobatic skill. The shield is impenetrable by even the strongest Adamantium,
				resistant to all temperature extremes, and unaffected by any known form of radiation; the 
				only way it can be damaged is by the direct breakdown of its molecular bonding.<br><br>
<b>Accessories</b>:Captain America frequently travels via a custom-built Harley-Davidson Custom Special 
				   motorcycle with S.H.I.E.L.D. modifications and/or a custom-built Chevrolet van
				   outfitted by the Wakanda Design Group; he uses Avengers Quinjets when necessary.
